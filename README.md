# Torrent Name Parser

Library for parsing filenames in torrent convention using regexes

The pattern is based on the naming conventions of files shared via torrent (p2p). It is relatively flexible (works with
most files), a more demanding version on the respect of torrent conventions, but also more complete is available at the
link mentioned above.
