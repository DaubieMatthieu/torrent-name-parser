# Torrent Name Parser

Library for parsing filenames in torrent convention using regexes

Regex available here: https://regex101.com/library/HNJVuO

The pattern is based on the naming conventions of files shared via torrent (p2p). It is relatively flexible (works with
most files), a more demanding version on the respect of torrent conventions, but also more complete is available at the
link mentioned above.
