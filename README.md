# Torrent Name Parser

Library for parsing filenames in torrent convention using regexes

### Notes

- Pattern: the chosen pattern is based on the naming conventions of files shared via torrent (p2p), more precisely the
  films and series files
- Regex: This regex is quite flexible, so it works with most files, I published
  it [here](https://regex101.com/library/HNJVuO) (there is two versions available, the v1 is more complete but more
  demanding)
